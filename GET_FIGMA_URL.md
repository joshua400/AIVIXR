# How to Get the Standard Figma File URL from Figma Make

## Method 1: From the Figma Make Link

1. **Click on your Figma Make link**: `https://www.figma.com/make/hkRdmP4OTXefdlvNY9hyYz/...`
2. **Wait for the file to open** in Figma (it may take a moment to load)
3. **Look at the browser address bar** - the URL will automatically change to the standard format
4. **The new URL will look like**:
   - `https://www.figma.com/file/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/File-Name`
   - OR `https://www.figma.com/design/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/File-Name`
5. **Copy that entire URL** and share it with me

## Method 2: From Within Figma

1. **Open Figma** in your browser (figma.com)
2. **Go to your Files** or **Recent Files**
3. **Find the file** named "Revise-Website-Navigation-and-Content" (or similar)
4. **Click to open it**
5. **Look at the URL** in your browser - it will show the standard format
6. **Copy the URL**

## Method 3: Share Link from Figma

1. **Open the file** in Figma (using Method 1 or 2)
2. **Click the "Share" button** (top right in Figma)
3. **Click "Copy link"** - this will give you the standard file URL
4. **Share that link** with me

## What I Need

Once you have the URL, it should look like one of these:
- `https://www.figma.com/file/ABC123XYZ789/Revise-Website-Navigation-and-Content`
- `https://www.figma.com/design/ABC123XYZ789/Revise-Website-Navigation-and-Content`

The important part is the **file key** (the `ABC123XYZ789` part) - that's what I need to fetch your design data!

## Quick Test

After you get the URL, you can verify it's the right format:
- ✅ Good: `figma.com/file/...` or `figma.com/design/...`
- ❌ Not usable: `figma.com/make/...` (this is what you have now)

Once you share the standard file URL, I'll immediately fetch all the design data and update the landing page to match exactly!
