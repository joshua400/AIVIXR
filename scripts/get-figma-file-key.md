# How to Get Your Figma File Key

The Figma "make" URL you provided doesn't work directly with the API. To fetch the exact design data, we need the standard Figma file URL.

## Steps to Get the File Key:

1. **Open the Figma file** in your browser (not the "make" link)
2. **Look at the URL** in your browser's address bar
3. The URL should look like one of these:
   - `https://www.figma.com/file/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/File-Name`
   - `https://www.figma.com/design/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/File-Name`
4. **Copy the entire URL** or just the `XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX` part (the file key)

## Alternative: If you only have the "make" URL

1. Click on the "make" link to open it in Figma
2. Once the file opens, look at the URL - it should change to the standard file format
3. Copy that new URL

Once you provide the standard file URL, I can:
- Fetch all design specifications
- Extract exact colors, fonts, and spacing
- Download all assets (images, icons)
- Update the landing page to match exactly
