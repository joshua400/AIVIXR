# Step-by-Step: Getting Your Figma File URL

## Follow These Exact Steps:

### Step 1: Open the Make Link
1. **Click this link** (or paste it in your browser):
   ```
   https://www.figma.com/make/hkRdmP4OTXefdlvNY9hyYz/Revise-Website-Navigation-and-Content?t=xiXTNpUXumD7Ogs7-1
   ```

### Step 2: Wait for File to Load
- The page will load and show your Figma design
- **Wait 5-10 seconds** for it to fully load

### Step 3: Look for "Open in Figma" Button
- At the top of the page, you should see a button that says:
  - **"Open in Figma"** 
  - OR **"Edit in Figma"**
  - OR a Figma logo/icon
- **Click that button**

### Step 4: Get the Standard URL
- After clicking, the file will open in Figma
- **Look at your browser's address bar** (the URL at the top)
- The URL will now be in this format:
  ```
  https://www.figma.com/file/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/Revise-Website-Navigation-and-Content
  ```
  OR
  ```
  https://www.figma.com/design/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/Revise-Website-Navigation-and-Content
  ```

### Step 5: Copy and Share
- **Select the entire URL** from the address bar
- **Copy it** (Cmd+C on Mac, Ctrl+C on Windows)
- **Paste it here** so I can access your design!

## Alternative Method: From Figma App/Website

If the above doesn't work:

1. Go to **figma.com** and sign in
2. Click on **"Files"** in the left sidebar
3. Look for a file named **"Revise-Website-Navigation-and-Content"**
4. Click to open it
5. Copy the URL from the address bar

---

## What the URL Should Look Like:

✅ **CORRECT FORMAT:**
```
https://www.figma.com/file/ABC123XYZ456DEF789/Revise-Website-Navigation-and-Content
```

❌ **NOT USABLE:**
```
https://www.figma.com/make/... (This is what you have now)
```

## Still Having Trouble?

If you can't find the standard URL:
1. **Take a screenshot** of the Figma design
2. **Share it with me** and I can help identify the design elements
3. Or describe the **colors, fonts, and layout** you see, and I'll match them

Once I have the standard file URL, I'll fetch everything automatically!
